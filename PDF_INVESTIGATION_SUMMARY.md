## 🔧 Technical Innovations

### 1. Fast Text Extractor
```python
class FastTextExtractor:
    @staticmethod
    def extract_text_fast(page) -> str:
        # Optimized extraction with fallback methods
        # Better error handling than standard pypdf
```

### 2. Adaptive Processing Strategy
```python
# Enhanced strategy selection based on:
# - File size AND page count
# - System CPU count
# - Optimal worker calculation
optimal_workers = min(max(total_pages // 25, 2), os.cpu_count() or 4)
```

### 3. Enhanced Caching
```python
# Improved cache key generation:
# - Fast keys for large files (>10MB)
# - Content-based hashing for accuracy
# - Automatic cache size management
```
