#### 📝 Write Documentation

Oboyu could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official Oboyu docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

#### 💡 Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/sonesuke/oboyu/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement
* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

## How to contribute

### First Time Contributors

Unsure where to begin contributing to Oboyu? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/sonesuke/oboyu/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/sonesuke/oboyu/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main`.

2. **Set up your development environment**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/oboyu.git
   cd oboyu
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Make your changes** in a new git branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

4. **Make sure your code passes all tests and style checks**:
   ```bash
   # Run fast tests during development
   uv run pytest -m "not slow" -k "not integration"
   
   # Run all tests before submitting
   uv run pytest --cov=src
   
   # Check code style
   uv run ruff check --fix
   
   # Type checking
   uv run mypy
   ```

5. **Add tests** for your changes. Make sure your changes are covered by tests and that all tests pass.

6. **Update documentation** if you are changing behavior or adding features.

7. **Commit your changes** using a descriptive commit message that follows our [commit message conventions](#commit-messages).

8. **Push your branch** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

9. **Submit a pull request** through the GitHub website.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.13+ on Linux and macOS.
4. Check that all tests pass in the GitHub Actions CI.

## Development Process

### Development Workflow

#### Code Quality

Oboyu uses several tools to maintain high code quality:

```bash
# Format and lint code
uv run ruff check --fix

# Type checking
uv run mypy

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src

# Run fast tests (excluding slow integration tests)
uv run pytest -m "not slow" -k "not integration"
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

- **Never use `--no-verify`** when committing
- Always fix lint errors and test failures before committing
- Pre-commit hooks maintain code quality automatically

### Testing

#### Test Categories

Oboyu has different test categories for efficient development:

```bash
# Fast tests (recommended for development)
uv run pytest -m "not slow" -k "not integration"

# All tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src

# Only slow tests (ML model loading, large datasets)
uv run pytest -m "slow"

# Only integration tests
uv run pytest -k "integration"

# Specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_file.py::test_function
```

#### Writing Tests

Follow these guidelines when writing tests:

1. **Use descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
2. **Mark slow tests** with `@pytest.mark.slow` decorator
3. **Use fixtures** for common test data and setup
4. **Test edge cases** and error conditions
5. **Keep tests focused** on a single functionality

Example:
```python
import pytest
from oboyu.indexer.indexer import Indexer

@pytest.mark.slow
def test_indexer_with_japanese_content():
    """Test that indexer properly handles Japanese text with MeCab tokenization."""
    # Test implementation
    pass

def test_indexer_configuration_validation():
    """Test that indexer validates configuration parameters correctly."""
    # Test implementation  
    pass
```

### Debugging

#### Logging

Enable debug logging for specific components:

```python
import logging

# Enable debug logging for specific components
logging.getLogger("oboyu.indexer").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger("oboyu.crawler").setLevel(logging.INFO)
```

#### Common Debug Scenarios

1. **Indexing Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Run with verbose output
   oboyu index ./docs --debug
   ```

2. **Search Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Interactive mode for testing
   oboyu query --interactive --debug
   ```

3. **MCP Server Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Run with debug logging
   oboyu mcp --debug
   ```

## Style Guides

### Python Code Style

- **Follow PEP 8** with Ruff enforcement
- **Use type hints** for all function signatures
- **Write docstrings** for all public functions and classes
- **Keep functions focused** and maintain single responsibility
- **Use descriptive variable names**
- **Maximum line length**: 100 characters
- **Use f-strings** for string formatting

Example:
```python
def process_japanese_text(
    text: str, 
    encoding: str = "utf-8"
) -> str:
    """Process Japanese text with proper normalization.
    
    Args:
        text: Input text to process
        encoding: Text encoding (default: utf-8)
        
    Returns:
        Normalized Japanese text
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If text cannot be decoded
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Commit Messages

```
type(scope): description

body (optional)

footer (optional)
```

#### Types

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance

- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Examples

```
feat(indexer): add support for PDF document processing

- Implement PDF text extraction using pypdf
- Add tests for PDF processing
- Update documentation

Closes #123
```

```
fix(cli): resolve issue with Japanese encoding detection

The crawler was failing to detect Shift-JIS encoding in some cases.
This fix adds additional heuristics for encoding detection.
```

### Documentation Style

- Use **Markdown** for all documentation
- Include **code examples** where appropriate
- Keep documentation **up to date** with code changes
- Use **clear and concise** language
- Include **Japanese examples** where relevant

## Code Analysis

### Using Repomix

When working on larger changes, use Repomix for codebase analysis:

```bash
# Install repomix globally
npm install -g repomix

# Generate codebase analysis
repomix

# Use with Claude Code for AI-assisted development
# The generated repomix-output.xml provides comprehensive context
```

When using Claude Code, include the compress option to reduce token usage:
```bash
# In Claude Code
mcp__repomix__pack_codebase(directory="/path/to/oboyu", compress=true)
```
