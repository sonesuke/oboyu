# Our Technology Decision Framework

*How we evaluate, select, and evolve our technology choices at Oboyu*

## üéØ Philosophy: Sincere, Experimental, Open

Our technology decisions reflect our core values:
- **Sincere**: We choose technologies that genuinely solve problems, not just trendy ones
- **Experimental**: We're willing to try innovative approaches and learn from failures
- **Open**: We prefer open-source solutions and share our learnings

## üìä The Oboyu Decision Matrix

When evaluating any technology, we score it across six dimensions:

### 1. **Problem Fit** (Weight: 30%)
- Does it directly address our specific challenge?
- Is it designed for our use case or a general solution?
- How well does it handle Japanese language specifics?

### 2. **Performance** (Weight: 25%)
- Measurable improvements in speed, accuracy, or efficiency
- Resource consumption (CPU, memory, storage)
- Scalability characteristics

### 3. **Community & Ecosystem** (Weight: 20%)
- Active development and maintenance
- Community size and engagement
- Available resources, documentation, and examples

### 4. **Integration Effort** (Weight: 15%)
- How easily does it fit into our existing architecture?
- Learning curve for our team
- Migration complexity from current solution

### 5. **Future Viability** (Weight: 7%)
- Long-term sustainability
- Vendor lock-in considerations
- Technology trajectory and evolution

### 6. **Alignment with Values** (Weight: 3%)
- Open-source preference
- Community values alignment
- Transparency and openness

## üìã Evaluation Checklist

### Technical Evaluation
```markdown
- [ ] **Proof of Concept**: Built working prototype
- [ ] **Benchmarking**: Measured performance vs alternatives
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Verified compatibility with existing stack
- [ ] **Resource Analysis**: Profiled CPU, memory, storage impact
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Tested failure modes and recovery
```

### Strategic Evaluation
```markdown
- [ ] **Community Health**: Checked GitHub activity, issue resolution
- [ ] **Documentation Quality**: Assessed learning resources and examples
- [ ] **Maintenance Burden**: Estimated ongoing operational costs
- [ ] **Lock-in Risk**: Evaluated switching costs and alternatives
- [ ] **Value Alignment**: Confirmed fit with open-source preference
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Philosophy

### 1. **Progressive Adoption**
```python
# Phase 1: Isolated experiment
def experiment_new_technology():
    # Small, contained test
    results = new_tech.prototype()
    return evaluate_results(results)

# Phase 2: Parallel implementation
def parallel_implementation():
    # Run alongside existing solution
    old_results = current_solution.process(data)
    new_results = new_solution.process(data)
    return compare_results(old_results, new_results)

# Phase 3: Gradual migration
def gradual_migration():
    # Migrate non-critical paths first
    if is_critical_path(request):
        return current_solution.process(request)
    else:
        return new_solution.process(request)
```

### 2. **Measurable Criteria**
Every technology decision must include:
- **Success Metrics**: Clear performance targets
- **Failure Criteria**: When to rollback or pivot
- **Timeline**: Evaluation period and decision point

### 3. **Reversibility**
```python
# Always maintain fallback options
class TechnologyGateway:
    def __init__(self):
        self.primary = new_solution
        self.fallback = current_solution
        self.success_rate = 0.0
    
    def process(self, request):
        try:
            result = self.primary.process(request)
            self.success_rate = self.update_success_rate(True)
            return result
        except Exception:
            self.success_rate = self.update_success_rate(False)
            if self.success_rate < 0.95:  # Rollback threshold
                return self.fallback.process(request)
            raise
```

## üéØ Common Decision Patterns

### Pattern 1: The "Japanese-First" Filter
For any NLP technology:
1. Can it handle Japanese text without preprocessing?
2. Does it understand cultural and linguistic nuances?
3. Is it trained on Japanese data, not just translated?

### Pattern 2: The "Embedded-First" Preference
For any infrastructure technology:
1. Can it run efficiently on personal devices?
2. Does it minimize external dependencies?
3. Is operational complexity low?

### Pattern 3: The "Open Source" Bias
For any core technology:
1. Is the source code available and auditable?
2. Can we modify it for our specific needs?
3. Does it have a healthy open-source community?

## üîÑ Continuous Re-evaluation

### Quarterly Technology Reviews
```python
# Automated monitoring of technology health
def evaluate_technology_stack():
    for technology in current_stack:
        health_score = {
            "performance": measure_performance(technology),
            "community": check_community_health(technology),
            "alternatives": survey_alternatives(technology),
            "satisfaction": team_satisfaction(technology)
        }
        
        if health_score["overall"] < threshold:
            trigger_reevaluation(technology)
```

### Trigger Points for Re-evaluation
- Performance degradation > 20%
- Community activity drops significantly
- Better alternatives emerge with > 2x improvement
- Major security or stability issues
- Team productivity impact

## üéì Lessons from Our Decisions

### What Worked Well
1. **Proof-of-concept first**: Saved us from bad choices
2. **Community research**: Active communities = better long-term outcomes
3. **Japanese-specific evaluation**: Generic solutions often fail
4. **Performance benchmarking**: Measurable improvements guide decisions

### What We'd Do Differently
1. **Earlier adoption**: Sometimes we waited too long to try new tech
2. **More migration planning**: Underestimated switching costs
3. **Better documentation**: Our decision rationale should be clearer
4. **Team input**: Include more voices in evaluation process

## üîÆ Future Evolution

### Technologies We're Watching
- **Rust for systems programming**: Memory safety + performance
