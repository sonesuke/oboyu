# Enhanced Solve Issue Workflow

This command implements an advanced GitHub issue resolution workflow with git worktree isolation, automated CI/CD monitoring, and intelligent PR management.

## üéØ Enhanced Workflow Overview

1. **Extract Issue Information**
   - Extract issue number from branch name
   - Fetch issue details from GitHub using `gh issue view {issue_number}`
   - Understand the problem, requirements, and acceptance criteria

2. **Initial Setup & Planning**
   - Create a comprehensive todo list for the implementation
   - Break down the issue into manageable tasks
   - Plan the implementation approach

3. **‚≠ê Worktree Environment Creation**
   - Create isolated development environment using git worktree
   - Enable parallel issue work without branch conflicts
   - Set up clean dependency environment

4. **Development with Early PR Creation**
   - Start implementation of the solution in isolated worktree
   - After first meaningful commit, create a **Draft PR** immediately
   - Use WIP title format: `WIP: Fix #{issue_number} - {issue_title}`
   - Link the issue in PR description with `Fixes #{issue_number}` or `Closes #{issue_number}`
   - Add comment to original issue: `Working on this in PR #{pr_number}`

5. **‚≠ê Automated CI/CD Monitoring**
   - Launch automated PR monitoring with real-time feedback
   - Auto-detect and fix common CI/CD issues (linting, formatting, imports)
   - Continuous 2-minute interval monitoring until completion

6. **Progress Tracking with Real-time Feedback**
   - Update PR title to reflect development progress:
     - `WIP: Fix #{issue_number} - [30%] Initial setup complete`
     - `WIP: Fix #{issue_number} - [70%] Core functionality implemented`
     - `Ready: Fix #{issue_number} - {final_title}`
   - Make regular commits with descriptive messages
   - Update PR description with implementation details and progress
   - Receive automated notifications of CI/CD status changes

7. **‚≠ê Auto-promotion to Ready**
   - Automatic promotion from Draft to Ready when all checks pass
   - Intelligent PR title updates reflecting completion status
   - Automated reviewer assignment based on changed files

8. **‚≠ê Cleanup & Finalization**
   - Automated worktree and branch cleanup after PR merge
   - Clean environment management for future work
   - Final status reporting and next steps guidance

## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Issue Analysis & Planning
```bash
# Extract issue number from current branch
ISSUE_NUMBER=$(git branch --show-current | grep -o '[0-9]\+' | head -1)

# Fetch detailed issue information
gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER

# Create comprehensive implementation plan
# - Break down requirements into specific tasks
# - Identify affected files and components
# - Plan testing strategy
# - Estimate implementation timeline
```

### Step 2: Worktree Environment Setup
```bash
# Get current project directory name
PROJECT_DIR=$(basename "$PWD")
ISSUE_NUMBER={issue_number}  # Replace with actual issue number
BRANCH_NAME=$(git branch --show-current)

# Create git worktree in parallel directory
git worktree add "../${PROJECT_DIR}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}" "${BRANCH_NAME}"

# Navigate to worktree
cd "../${PROJECT_DIR}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}"

# Install dependencies in the isolated environment
uv sync

# Verify worktree status
git worktree list
echo "‚úÖ Isolated development environment ready"
```

### Step 3: Initial Development & PR Creation
```bash
# Start implementation in the worktree
# Make meaningful initial commits

# After first significant commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial implementation for issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER}"
git push -u origin ${BRANCH_NAME}

# Create Draft PR with proper linking
gh pr create --draft \
  --title "WIP: Fix #${ISSUE_NUMBER} - {issue_title}" \
  --body "Fixes #${ISSUE_NUMBER}

## üéØ Problem

## üí° Solution Approach
{High-level implementation strategy}

## üìã Progress Checklist
- [ ] Core functionality implemented
- [ ] Tests written/updated
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code quality checks passed

## üîó Related
- Issue: #${ISSUE_NUMBER}
- Branch: ${BRANCH_NAME}
- Worktree: ${PROJECT_DIR}-issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}"

# Get PR number for monitoring
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr list --head ${BRANCH_NAME} --json number --jq '.[0].number')
echo "üìù Draft PR #${PR_NUMBER} created"
```

### Step 4: Launch Automated Monitoring
```bash
# Start automated CI/CD monitoring in background
.claude/scripts/monitor-pr-checks.sh ${PR_NUMBER} &
MONITOR_PID=$!

echo "ü§ñ Automated monitoring started (PID: ${MONITOR_PID})"
echo "üìä Monitoring will:"
echo "  - Check PR status every 2 minutes"
echo "  - Auto-fix common CI/CD issues"
echo "  - Auto-promote to Ready when all checks pass"
echo "  - Run until manually stopped (Ctrl+C)"
```

### Step 5: Development with Real-time Feedback
```bash
# Continue development with regular commits
# The monitoring system will automatically:
# - Detect failing checks
# - Apply auto-fixes for common issues
# - Commit and push fixes
# - Update PR status

# Manual progress updates
gh pr edit ${PR_NUMBER} --title "WIP: Fix #${ISSUE_NUMBER} - [50%] Core implementation complete"

# Update PR description with progress
gh pr edit ${PR_NUMBER} --body "$(cat <<EOF
Fixes #${ISSUE_NUMBER}

```

### Step 6: Quality Assurance & Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive quality checks
uv run ruff check --fix && uv run mypy
uv run pytest -m "not slow" -k "not integration"

# The monitoring system handles this automatically, but manual execution is also available:
.claude/scripts/fix-common-issues.sh
```

### Step 7: Automated Promotion (Handled Automatically)
The monitoring system will automatically:
- Detect when all CI/CD checks pass
- Update PR title from "WIP:" to "Ready:"
- Convert PR from Draft to Ready for Review
- Notify about completion

### Step 8: Cleanup After Merge
```bash
# After PR is merged, return to main project
cd ../{main_project_directory}

# Use automated cleanup script
.claude/scripts/cleanup-issue-worktree.sh ${ISSUE_NUMBER}

# Verify cleanup
git worktree list
echo "üßπ Cleanup completed"
```
