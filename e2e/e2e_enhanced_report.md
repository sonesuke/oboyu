## Test Results

### Error Display

## Error Display Assessment

The error output shows **good consistency** across most commands with some notable differences:

**✅ Positive aspects:**
- Commands 1, 2, and 4 follow a consistent format with clear usage hints and error messages
- Error messages are concise and actionable
- No garbled text or encoding issues
- Clean separation between stdout and stderr

**⚠️ Inconsistency found:**
Command 3 has a different error format compared to the others:
- Uses emoji (❌) in stdout while others use plain text
- Shows detailed logging with timestamps and file locations in stderr
- More verbose error output with stack trace-like information

**Recommendations:**
1. **Standardize error output format** - Either all commands should use emojis or none
2. **Consider hiding verbose logging** by default for command 3, making it available only with a `--verbose` flag
3. **Unify error prefix** - Commands 1,2,4 use "Error:" while command 3 uses "❌ Search failed:"

The error messages are functionally clear and helpful, but the inconsistent formatting between command 3 and the others creates a less cohesive user experience.
